/**
 This is mostly a convenience operator that allows you to take an optional value and pass it into a transform.
 At it's core, it allows you to avoid common code like:
 
 ```
 if let x = y {
 self.z = self.mapToZ(y)
 } else {
 self.z = nil
 }
 ```
 
 into a single line:
 ```
 self.z = x ?>> { self.mapToZ($0) }
 ```

/**
 This is an assignment operator that allows you to take an item, configure it in a closure, and then return the configured object
 as an assignment.  It essentially replaces the generic closure pattern that returns an object (`() -> T`) by separating out the creation and return
 from the configuration. A great example is iVars:
 
 ```
 let someIvar: Variable = {
   let var = Variable()
   var.configA = A
   var.configB = B
   return var
 }()
 ```
 
 This is a common usage pattern.  However, it's a bit verbose and requires two extra lines (creation and return).  Using the `<<` we can shorten it considerably:
 
 ```
 let someIvar = Variable() << {
   $0.configA = A
   $0.configB = B
 }
 ```
 
 Note: You can also use this purely for configuration, without assignment, but it's generally intended for assignment.
