 A protocol that defines a basic API request.
 This is the primary interface that determines the request made to the API
 and how the returned data will be processed.
 
 As such, there are two primary associatedType:
  - Response: Decodable - Must be some Decodabel object that can handle
 the full response of the returned data.
  - Decoder - Must be capable of taking Data and decoding it into the Response object (ex: JSONDecoder)
 
 The type, url, and parameters will be used to construct the URLRequest
 The decodable and decoder are used to date the received data and transform it
 into the requested object.
